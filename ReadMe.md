## ReadMe
* This repo is for the Course Project in the Getting and Cleaning Data course at Coursera.
* Included here is a file with the code for producing a tidy dataset providing the mean values, by activity and by subject, of a series of measurements done
for the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. Description of the original data is provided through the following link:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
* The code file included in this repository is "run_analysis.R" and it assembles both the testing and training datasets provided, for 6 different activities
and 30 different human subjects, totalling 10,299 observations of 651 different measurements, some of which are means and standard-deviations of yet
more basic values. These means and standard deviations were extracted and the output dataset of this code is made of averages of each of those, 
by activity and subject.
* A codebook file is also included with the list of variables provided in the output dataset, and of those of which, in the original data, they are averages.
